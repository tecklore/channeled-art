    '        <p>Channelled Oil Painting is based on the art of stepping out of one\'s own way and allowing soul to move to the ' +
    '          fore and take over all aspects of creation.</p>\n' +
    '        <p>There is no planning.</p>\n' +
    '        <p>\"Mind\" does not become involved till the theme of the work has already been established by the spontaneous ' +
    '          appearance of forms in the painting.</p>\n' +
    '        <p>The artist practices an hour of yoga and an hour of meditation before approaching the canvas so the mind is ' +
    '          settled and has little to do with the initial abstract stage of a painting`s development.</p>\n' +
    '        <p>The fundamental forms in the fire above were created in seconds by dabbing a rag ramdmly in the wet paint ' +
    '          during one of the painting\'s most passionate moments. The artist added very little to what the rag put in - ' +
    '          mostly by darkening the negative space above the flames to bring the forms out.</p>\n' +
    '        <p>This series of paintings was begun in an Ashram (any place dedicated to evolving one\'s spirituality) where ' +
    '          the artist had gone to re-create himself. Much like the movie \"Work, Pray, Love\" he had abandoned a six figure ' +
    '          salary to persue something more meaningful.</p>\n' +
    '        <p>During his journey, the artist discovered something peculiar about reality. The laws of physics did not ' +
    '          encompass or explain all there is to the world. The deeper he went into spirituality, the more the phenomenon ' +
    '          of the spontaneous appearance of forms in his painting occurred. The artist soon began to realise he was ' +
    '          communicating with something and that the paintings had become a medium of communication.</p>\n' +
    '        <p>Using techniques nobody has discovered yet, the artist randomises the paintings so the forms in them ' +
    '          spontaneously appear. At the most dramatic point in every painting\'s creation, the wet paint on the entire ' +
    '          canvas is physically moving at a glacially slow pace so the forms are determined by things like gravity, the ' +
    '          angle of the canvass, slight physical depressions, the random dabbing of a cloth or the random spilling of ' +
    '          liquids on the surface.</p>\n' +
    '        <p>The less thought the artist put into the work, the more the forms showed up. It is only after they show up ' +
    '          that the artist\'s skills as a craftsman come into play.</p>',

    '          <p> Angel of Fire is an example of the phenomenon of spontaneous apparition that occurs in a hight percentage ' +
    '            of these paintings. </p>\n' +
    '          <p>The artist has discovered from his experiences that there exists a completerly different order of ' +
    '            intelligence in the world - something that has nothing to do with mind or rationalism. It is meteroic (very ' +
    '            quick to present finished solutions out of nowhere), intuitive and capable of expressing and understanding ' +
    '            extremely complex issues, especially concerning matters of the heart.</p>\n' +

    '          <p>It does not conflict with rationalism or the mind. On the contrary, they work together - the one leading ' +
    '            the direction of thought and the other building the logical connections to what intuition already knows.</p> ' +
    '          <p>These paintings are examples of this process which is divorced from logic or the mind. The commentaries are ' +

    '<p> Angel of Fire arose from a portrait the artist was doing of a beautiful mentor, rich in wisdom and passion. In fact, it was she who taught him how to paint with passion instead of technique.</p>\n' +
    '<p>He tried really hard to make the painting look like her but it faught him all the way. He questioned his goddess as to why he could not do this painting.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Her answer was to turn the painting around one day. Lo and behold, while he was fighting to shape the image according to his own agenda, she had created, without him even knowing about it, the perfect portrait.</p>\n' +
    '<p>His former mentor is a spiritual guru of the highest sort - powerful, grounded, utterly devoted to her vision of god, streaming in his energy every moment of her life. Yet, created by the negative space in her, as in the negative space of the painting, is a huge, winged nightmare shape tearing at her throat. </p>\n' +
    '<p>"A more perfect portrait of who she is I can not think of."</p>\n' +
    '<p>The arm and front edge of the face are the only things the artist added to the portrait. The hair, the body language and the winged shape were already there. If you turn the painting upside down, you can still see what the artist tried to create with his mind.</p>',
